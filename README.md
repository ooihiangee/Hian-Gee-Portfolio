## [Project 1: Web Scraping for Game Hero Skin Wallpapers](https://github.com/ooihiangee/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/1.%20Web%20Scraping%20for%20Game%20Hero%20Skin%20Wallpapers)
* Used the requests library to send HTTP GET requests to a URL and retrieve JSON data containing information about heroes and their skins.
* Used the .json() method to parse the JSON response into a Python dictionary for easy manipulation.
* Implemented exception handling (try-except) to handle cases where the hero['skin_name'] key is missing in the JSON data.
* Used the open() function to create and write content to image files ('wb' mode for binary write).
* Utilised the time.sleep() function to introduce a delay between requests, preventing overwhelming the server.

I was able to scrape the hero wallpapers from the official website using Python.

## [Entrepreneurial Competency Study](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/1515d8b6-1efb-417a-ab6a-50bffe05a2ba/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)
The dataset consists of responses collected from the university students via entrepreneurial competency study survey. It collects respondents' demographics, existence of several personality traits such as resilience, competitiveness and etc weighted on a scale of 1 to 5, reasons behind lack of interest in entrepreneurship as well as whether the student is likely to become an entrepreneur or not.

* The respondents' ages range from 17 to 26 years old and most of them are aged 20 at a count of 79. The number of males undertake number of females at all ages except 23 and 25. At age of 23, there is a male and a female respondent, while at age of 25, there is only 1 female respondent.
* From the chart, entrepreneurs achieve higher average scores for all attributes namely Strong Need to Achieve, Self-Reliance, Desire to Take Initiatives, Competitiveness, Self-Confidence, Good Physical Health, and Perseverance compared to non-entrepreneurs. Least discrepancies exhibit in the average score of Competitiveness between both groups.
* The top reason for lack of interest in entrepreneurship is solely no interest. A total of 63 respondents desire to work in the corporate sector, for the government, pursue research or something else instead of taking part in entrepreneurship activities. It is followed by lack of knowledge (45) and academic pressure (36). Another significant and common reason is not able to take the financial risk at a count of 33.
* 85.71% of the entrepreneurs involved in the study were influenced. On the other hand, it also shows that a considerable number of individuals influenced before do not pursue entrepreneurship which occupy for 62.5% of the non-entrepreneurs. Thus, we are hard to conclude that there is a strong association between early influence and an individual's likelihood of embarking on the entrepreneurial journey.
